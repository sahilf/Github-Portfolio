## Research & Publications

### Automation In Agricultural Field Using Decentralized Framework
**August 2020 - May 2021**

Designed a decentralized system where autonomous bots allocate areas among themselves, generate paths within their designated zones, and traverse efficiently. This project introduced a novel path-planning method for optimal navigation within polygon-shaped agricultural fields.

**Technologies:** Python, Path Planning Algorithms, Autonomous Systems, Decentralized Architecture

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed algorithms for autonomous area allocation among multiple bots
- Implemented efficient path-planning within irregular polygon shapes
- Published at IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing, and Communication Technologies (CONECCT), 2021

**Publication:** [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9622347)
